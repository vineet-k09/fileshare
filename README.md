## RoadMap

üî® Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP - Local File Sharing via Browser

‚úÖ Set up Node.js Express server

‚úÖ Build a React frontend with drag-and-drop UI

‚úÖ Upload files from browser ‚Üí save to /uploads on server

‚úÖ Serve frontend and API from Express

‚úÖ Access via http://<host-ip>:3000 on all hotspot-connected devices

### Phase 2: Desktop Integration

‚¨ú Use Electron.js to wrap the app into a desktop application

‚¨ú Add OS-level shell commands to control Wi-Fi hotspot:

Windows: netsh

Linux: nmcli

macOS: networksetup

‚¨ú Auto-start server + hotspot when app launches

### Phase 3: Enhanced File Sharing Features

‚¨ú Show available devices on network (via ping/ARP scan)

‚¨ú UI for each device as a card

‚¨ú Drag file to device card to send specific file to that device (instead of broadcasting)

‚¨ú Broadcast file notification to all clients using WebSocket

‚¨ú Browser push notification when a new file is available

‚¨ú Sound alert when file is received (like AirDrop)

### Phase 4: Performance & Streaming Support

‚¨ú Enable streaming or chunked upload/download for large files:

Node: res.write() for streaming

Consider WebSockets with chunking logic

For React Native (if used): use background workers or fetch streaming APIs

‚¨ú Progress bar during file transfer

‚¨ú Resume/retry support for interrupted transfers (optional)

### Phase 5: Mobile-Native Option (Optional)

‚¨ú Build a React Native app for Android/iOS

‚¨ú Use device local IP to connect to host server

‚¨ú Integrate file upload/download

‚¨ú Implement QR scan to connect

```json
"scripts": {
  "buildCopy": "npm run build && cp -r build/* ../backend/public/",
  
  "deploy-frontend": "powershell -Command \"Remove-Item ../backend/public/* -Recurse -Force; npm run build; Copy-Item -Path build/* -Destination ../backend/public/ -Recurse\""

}
```
